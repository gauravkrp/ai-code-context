Create a python app that scans a github codebase, scans all the files and code and indexes/embeds them to query for a question. Query could be finding a piece of code that implements a certain feature, or finding a bug, or finding a function that does something. Further, the app will be connected to a slack channel and when ever a message is posted in the slack channel, the app will scan the codebase for the answer and post the answer in the slack channel. Message could be a question, or why a certain feature is that way, or a bug or why something is not visible (for e.g like a button is not visible for certain users, the app will understand that the user is asking about a button and will scan the codebase for the button and will post the answer in the slack channel as the user might not have permission to see the button).
